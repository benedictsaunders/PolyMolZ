 # PolyMolZ
 A modified version of Liam Wilbraham's MolZ module, which works with the output of PolyHTS2 and uses the monomers in each case as fragments, as well as the querying of multiple properties. The underlying principle is the same however, calculating z-scores from the hypergeometric distribution.

## Requirements:
* RDKit
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* SQLite3
